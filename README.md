# Air-Quality-Prediction-using-Python

This project uses Python to predict air quality based on sensor data, which includes various atmospheric parameters such as CO, NOx, temperature, and humidity. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the use of machine learning models for air quality forecasting.

Features:
1. Data Loading: Loads air quality data with various parameters like CO(GT), NOx(GT), NO2(GT), Temperature, Relative Humidity, etc.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalization, and formatting of time series data.
3. Feature Engineering: Creates additional features such as moving averages and lag features for better model performance.
4. Modeling: Implements machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks for prediction tasks.
5. Evaluation: Provides metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and visualizations of model performance.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains time-series data with multiple parameters recorded at different timestamps, such as CO levels, NOx levels, temperature, and humidity. The dataset is publicly available and can be found at UCI Machine Learning Repository.
